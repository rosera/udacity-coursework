# Cloud Developer

* Time: 4 Months
* Pre-requisite: Intermediate JavaScript

### Cloud Developer
Start by learning the fundamentals of cloud development and deployment with AWS. Then, build different apps leveraging microservices, 
Kubernetes clusters, and serverless application technology.



## Course Outline

- [ ] Welcome to the [Cloud Developer Nanodegree](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd9990/dashboard/overview)
- [ ] Cloud Fundamentals 
- [ ] Full Stack Apps on AWS
- [ ] Monolith to Microservices at Scale
- [ ] Develop & Deploy Serverless App
- [ ] Capstone

## 1. Cloud Fundamentals

### Project - Deploy Static Website on AWS

The cloud is perfect for hosting static websites that only include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that 
require no server-side processing. In this project, you will deploy a static website to AWS. First, you 
will create a S3 bucket and upload the website files to your bucket. Next, you will configure the bucket 
for website hosting and secure it using IAM policies. Next, you will speed up content delivery using AWSâ€™ 
content distribution network service, CloudFront. Lastly, you will access your website in a browser using 
the unique CloudFront endpoint.

## 2. Full Stack Apps on AWS

### Project - Udagram: Your Own Instagram on AWS

### Project - Optimize your GitHub Profile

## 3. Monolith to Microservices at Scale

### Project - Refactor Monolith to Microservices and Deploy

#### Preparing to Start the Project
This project uses AWS services including an S3 bucket and an RDS instance. You may have already have these 
services running from an earlier project, but in case you don't we'll review the set up in the next few 
sections:

* Setting up an AWS S3 bucket
* Setting up an AWS RDS instance
* Using Environment Variables


## 4. Develop & Deploy Serverless App

### Project - Serverless App

#### Serverless TODO Application
In this project, you will create a simple TODO application using AWS Lambda and Serverless framework. 
Search for all comments starting with the TODO: in the code to find the placeholders that you need to implement.

### Project - Take 30 Min to improve your LinkedIn

## 5. Capstone

### Project - Capstone

#### Overview
The purpose of the cloud developer capstone project is to give you a chance to combine what you've learned 
throughout the program. This project will be an important part of your portfolio that will help you achieve 
your Cloud-related career goals.

In this project, you will build a cloud-based application, and follow the principles of either the 
Microservices course (course 3) or the Serverless course (course 4). This will help you demonstrate to 
potential employers and colleagues that you can independently create and deploy applications using these 
principles.

#### Suggested Applications
Possible application ideas would be miniature versions of existing social media or video sharing applications 
-- any app that can take user input, store it, and allow for user retrieval. The app would also allow for users 
to log in to access data specific to each user.
